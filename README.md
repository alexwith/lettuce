# ðŸ¥¬ Lettuce

Lettuce is a redis server written in Go. It implements the [RESP protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/) and should therefore work with any redis client.

### Notes

- This is just a fun project for learning about Golang and TCP-based protocols, but I do attempt to make it as fast and functional as possible.
- There is **no persistence** implemented, so Lettuce should only be utilised as a cache or pub/sub.
- This implementation is based on the RESP3 version of the protocol released with Redis 6

## Getting Started

If you want to use the pre-existing Lettuce server, navigate to it's location and execute: `go run .`
This will start the lettuce server on port `6380`.

You can also create your own custom redis server. Execute `go get github.com/alexwith/lettuce` in your own project, then initiate the server. The following example will also register a custom command:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/alexwith/lettuce/command"
  "github.com/alexwith/lettuce/lettuce"
  "github.com/alexwith/lettuce/protocol"
)

const HOST string = "127.0.0.1"
const PORT int16 = 6380

func main()  {
  lettuce.Setup(HOST, PORT, func() {
    registerCommands()
  })
}

func registerCommands()  {
  command.RegisterCommand("CUSTOMPING", -1, func(connection *protocol.Connection, context *command.CommandContext)  {
    if len(context.Args) <= 0 {
      connection.WriteSimpleString("CUSTOMPONG")
      return
    }

    response := context.StringArg(0)
    connection.WriteBulkString(response)
  })
}
```
