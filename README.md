# ðŸ¥¬ Lettuce

Lettuce is a redis server written in Go. It implements the [RESP protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/) and should therefore work with any redis client. 

It is worth noting that this is just a fun project for learning purposes, but I do attempt to make it as fast and functional as possible.

## Features
### RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol)
- [ ] Simple Strings
- [ ] Errors
- [ ] Integers
- [x] Bulk Strings
- [x] Arrays
- [ ] Null elements in Arrays
- [ ] Pipelining

### Commands
I will only be implementing the most important commands, as I will not have time to implement the 450+ redis commands that exist. 
- [ ] PING 
- [ ] KEYS 
- [ ] SET
- [ ] GET
- [ ] APPEND
- [ ] DEL
- [ ] FLUSHALL
