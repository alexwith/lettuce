# ðŸ¥¬ Lettuce

Lettuce is a redis server written in Go. It implements the [RESP protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/) and should therefore work with any redis client. 

It is worth noting that this is just a fun project for learning purposes, but I do attempt to make it as fast and functional as possible.

## Features
### RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol)
- [x] Simple Strings
- [x] Errors
